# Battery Management Systems, Volume 1: Battery Modeling

The BMS I from Gregory Plett is great introduction to the huge problem of battery modeling.
It introduces the topics of equivalent circuit models, physical models of varient scales (micro and macro), explains how to reduce simulation time and explains how to extend the baisic models.

In this folder most of the examples from the respected chapters will be implemented in python.
Additionally, further visualistion tools are added to get a better
